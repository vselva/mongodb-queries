Use $match / $sort early
Ensure $match / $sort uses indexes properly 

Avoid using $project before $match 
Avoid using $group before $match 
- Because after $project / $group index usage will be dropped

Limit $lookup / $unwind usage 
$lookup to use localField / foriegnField to use indexed field

Use $facet wisely 

Use $limit / $skip carefully 

Avoid large group aggregation 

Use Allow "allowDiskUse" in aggregate (as second option) for large $group and $sort operations
use .explain("executionStats");
use .explain("allPlansExecution");
